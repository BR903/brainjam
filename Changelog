* 2020 Mar 05: version 0.9.2

	Code tests are now provided to validate the game logic code, and
	can be run via the makefile using "make check".

	Performance of the redo library was improved.

	The images that are compiled into the program have been
	reorganized, and there have been some minor changes to improve
	the code organization.

* 2020 Feb 29: version 0.9.1

	This version has no real change to the program behavior -- just to
	how it works internally. The biggest one is that images are now
	stored as PNGs, not just in the source tree but also in the
	binary. The program now has a dependency on libpng, but this has
	turned out to be easier to deal with than having the build process
	have a dependency on libpng.

	The python scripts are no long a mandatory part of the build
	process. One has been replaced with a short C program, and the
	other has been made optional. Taking python out of the build
	dependencies should simplify the process of making packages.

* 2020 Feb 26: version 0.9.0

	The encoding of the game state has been rewritten, in such a way
	that equivalent game states can be seen as identical if they only
	differ in the ordering of cards in the reserve, or likewise in the
	positioning of the tableau stacks. This change, along with a
	change to how moves are recorded internally, allows the redo
	library to do a much better job in recognizing when solutions can
	be merged. (This is a change that's been on the to-do list for
	years, so it's good to finally have it marked off.) Unfortunately,
	the change to the state encoding is reflected in the session data
	files, so saved session data files from before 0.9 are not usable.
	This could perhaps be addressed, but I strongly suspect currently
	that there is basically one regular user of this program at this
	time, and he's already manually translated his data files.

	The --validate option has been added, which can be used to check
	data files for errors.

	Added an option to display the move keys next to each place in the
	layout, to help with using the key commands.

	Various bug fixes and tweaks.

* 2020 Feb 16: version 0.8.3

	Revamped the initial display a little bit, adding buttons for
	navigating unsolved games. A clipboard button has also been added
	for copying solutions.

* 2020 Feb 07: version 0.8.2

	Many code changes to make the code more portable. The program now
	compiles cleanly on MacOS using clang. The biggest change involved
	replacing the assembly files with a macro that generates an in-line
	assembler block.

	Bug fixes and documentation updates.
	
* 2020 Jan 14: version 0.8.1

	Addressed Windows rendering bug. (It was caused by a bug in SDL2,
	which will be fixed in the next version. This workaround just
	avoids triggering the bug for now.)
	
	Changed save dirs to conform to the XDG standard.

	Many small code and documentation tweaks, some that fix bugs and
	some that are just small improvements.
	
* 2020 Jan 10: version 0.8

	There is now a proper ./configure script. The various build
	configurations are implemented as options to configure.

	We have Windows support! Cross-compiling for Windows is working,
	and pre-built binaries have been uploaded to the website. There
	are still some weird rendering bugs on Windows that don't appear
	on Linux, though.

	Lots of little bug fixes, as they are identified.

	Lots of documentation tweaks.
	
* 2020 Jan 06: version 0.7
	
	The initial public release. The program is a fully working beta
	version, though still lacking some things like as a proper
	./configure script. See TODO for details.

	(I first started working on this program almost exactly ten years
	ago. Since then I've been in a repeating pattern of doing a little
	work on it before abandoning it for a couple of years. It's high
	time I actually finished it.)
