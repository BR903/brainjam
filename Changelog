* 2020 Jan 10: version 0.8

	There is now a proper ./configure script. The various build
	configurations are implemented as options to configure.

	We have Windows support! Cross-compiling for Windows is working,
	and pre-built binaries have been uploaded to the website. There
	are still some weird rendering bugs on Windows that don't appear
	on Linux, though.

	Lots of little bug fixes, as they are identified.

	Lots of documentation tweaks.
	
* 2020 Jan 06: version 0.7
	
	The initial public release. The program is a fully working beta
	version, though still lacking some things like as a proper
	./configure script. See TODO for details.

	(I first started working on this program almost exactly ten years
	ago. Since then I've been in a repeating pattern of doing a little
	work on it before abandoning it for a couple of years. It's high
	time I actually finished it.)
