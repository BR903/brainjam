* 2020 Feb 07: version 0.8.2

	Many code changes to make the code more portable. The program now
	compiles cleanly on MacOS using clang. The biggest change involved
	replacing the assembly files with a macro that generates an in-line
	assembler block.

	Bug fixes and documentation updates.
	
* 2020 Jan 14: version 0.8.1

	Addressed Windows rendering bug. (It was caused by a bug in SDL2,
	which will be fixed in the next version. This workaround just
	avoids triggering the bug for now.)
	
	Changed save dirs to conform to the XDG standard.

	Many small code and documentation tweaks, some that fix bugs and
	some that are just small improvements.
	
* 2020 Jan 10: version 0.8

	There is now a proper ./configure script. The various build
	configurations are implemented as options to configure.

	We have Windows support! Cross-compiling for Windows is working,
	and pre-built binaries have been uploaded to the website. There
	are still some weird rendering bugs on Windows that don't appear
	on Linux, though.

	Lots of little bug fixes, as they are identified.

	Lots of documentation tweaks.
	
* 2020 Jan 06: version 0.7
	
	The initial public release. The program is a fully working beta
	version, though still lacking some things like as a proper
	./configure script. See TODO for details.

	(I first started working on this program almost exactly ten years
	ago. Since then I've been in a repeating pattern of doing a little
	work on it before abandoning it for a couple of years. It's high
	time I actually finished it.)
