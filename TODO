Before 1.0:

* Work on the layout for the opening screen. Seems like it could be
  improved.

* The game needs its own icon, instead of using the old windows icon.

* Add unit tests for the game logic code. This will probably also
  require new Makefile rules.

* Create a debian package, to simplify installation for various Linux
  distro users.

* Is there an equivalent for Windows, without going the full
  wininstall route? Is it enough to just create a self-extracting zip?

* Make a full pass through the documentation, looking for errors and
  outdated information.

* Make a full pass through the comments and code, likewise. Add
  copyright/license notice to all source files.

After 1.0:

* Add feature to generate a new layout, random but guaranteed to be
  solvable. Such games would not have a configuration ID and would not
  generate saved solutions. These differences might require changes in
  a few different areas of the existing code. However, such a feature
  would allow users to play the game more than 1500 times. This will
  require finding an algorithm that reliably generates a new,
  solvable, not boring game. I've managed to do first two easily
  enough, but the third has completely eluded my efforts so far.
