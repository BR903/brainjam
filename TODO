Before 1.0:

* BUG: If the user deletes (i.e. uses undo-and-forget) the last
  position of a solution, the program doesn't detect that the minimum
  solution size for the session may now be incorrect, or that the
  session may not even have a solution. Fixing this requires
  (potentially) a complete traversal of the tree. This should probably
  be considered a bug in libredo, and fixed there. (Though another fix
  would be to just forbid deleting endpoint positions.)

* Work on the layout for the opening screen. Seems like it could be
  improved.

* The game needs a real icon.

* Make a full pass through the documentation, looking for errors and
  outdated information.

* Make a full pass through the comments and code, likewise. Add
  copyright/license notice to all source files.

After 1.0:

* Add feature to generate a new layout, random but guaranteed to be
  solvable. Such games would not have a configuration ID and would not
  generate saved solutions. These differences might require changes in
  a few different areas of the existing code. However, such a feature
  would allow users to play the game more than 1500 times. This will
  require finding an algorithm that reliably generates a new,
  solvable, not boring game. I've managed to do first two easily
  enough, but the third has completely eluded my efforts so far.
