* BUG (?): On Wine, the window comes up all-black after being restored
  from a minimized state. I haven't seen this happen on an actual
  Windows host, but then I haven't been able to test it widely. The
  solution seems to be to create a brand-new renderer and re-create
  all of the existing textures from scratch, which is a pain in the
  neck if this only affects Wine users. Seems unlikely, though.

* Come up with a more attractive layout for the opening screen.

* Add unit tests for the game logic code. This will probably also
  require new Makefile rules.

* Improve the calculation of solution equivalence, so that two states
  that differ only in (say) the ordering of reserve cards are seen as
  equivalent. This will require the game state encoding to change, so
  that individual reserves and tableau piles do not keep their
  identities, but are simply listed in some fixed ordering. (It is not
  clear if this will in turn require extra state data to be appended.)
  Moves will also need to be stored differently internally, recording
  the card being moved instead of the place it came from. That will
  change the encoding of the session files.

* Add feature to generate a new layout, random but guaranteed to be
  solvable. Such games would not have a configuration ID and would not
  generate saved solutions. These differences might require changes in
  a few different areas of the existing code. However, such a feature
  would allow users to play the game more than 1500 times. This will
  require finding an algorithm that reliably generates a new,
  solvable, not boring game. I've managed to work out how to do the
  first two, but the third has completely eluded my efforts so far.
