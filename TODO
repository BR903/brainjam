Before 1.0:

* The game needs a real icon. This is now the main issue blocking a
  1.0 release.

* The layout for the opening screen could stand some improvement, but
  I don't have any concrete ideas on that score at the moment.

After 1.0:

* Add feature to generate a new layout, random but guaranteed to be
  solvable. Such games would not have a configuration ID and would not
  generate saved answers. These differences might require changes in a
  few different areas of the existing code. However, such a feature
  would allow users to play the game more than 1500 times. This will
  require finding an algorithm that reliably generates a new,
  solvable, not boring game. I've managed to do first two easily
  enough, but the third has completely eluded my efforts so far.
