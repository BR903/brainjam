  * ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

Brain Jam is a solitaire card game. It is similar to soltaire games
like Freecell in that the entire deck is dealt out face up at the
start, so the player has full information. However, unlike many
solitaire programs, Brain Jam comes with a large but finite number of
initial orderings, all of which are guaranteed to be solvable. Thus
there is no luck factor in playing Brain Jam.

Once you have solved a given configuration, you can then go back and
work to find a new answer with fewer moves.


  * NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS

The Brain Jam installer should set up everything for you. If you
didn't create a menu item or shortcut (or if you installed Brain Jam
yourself via a zip file), then you can run brainjam.exe directly
from this folder to play the game.


  * HOW TO PLAY

Within the program, you can press the question-mark button (or type
"?" or "F1") at any time to see the rules of the game, the interface
commands, etc. The rules of the game are very simple.


  * USER DATA

Brain Jam comes with no external data files, but it will create its
own files when it runs, in order to store your progress. Typically,
these files will be located in the following folder:

  Linux:   $HOME/.config/brainjam/
  Mac:     $HOME/Library/Application Support/brainjam/
  Windows: $HOME\Application Data\brainjam\

The file "brainjam.ini" in this folder holds your settings. You should
not normally need to modify this file directly. However, if you choose
you can use this file to change the font used by the program. To do
this, edit the text file and add a line that reads (e.g.):

  font=times

to use the installed Times font. Alternately, you can provide a
explicit path to a font file.

The folder can also contains a file named "brainjam.sol", which holds
your best answer for each game. If you played Brain Jam using the
original 16-bit Windows program, you can copy your old "brainjam.sol"
file into this folder, and this program will then have a record of all
of your previosly solved games.


  * BUILDING FROM SOURCE

If you are building from source, you will need to have installed the
following libraries, including their header files:

  ncursesw
  fontconfig
  SDL2
  SDL2_ttf
  libpng

For users on a debian-based distribution, the following command should
be sufficient to ensure all these dependencies are satisfied:

  sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpng-dev libncursesw5-dev libfontconfig-dev

Note that you can use the ./configure script to remove some of these
dependencies the cost of decreased functionality. The option
"--without-ncurses" will drop the ncurses dependency, at the cost of
removing the text-terminal interface. Similarly, the option
"--without-sdl" will remove the dependency on SDL2, SDL2_ttf, and
libpng, at the cost of only providing a text-terminal interface.
Finally, the option "--without-fontconfig" will remove the dependency
on libfontconfig, at the cost of requiring you to explicitly set the
path to the program's font in "brainjam.ini".

Running "make install" will install the binary and a man page.


  * BUILDING VIA HOMEBREW

If you are a homebrew user, you should be able to automatically build
Brain Jam with the command:

  brew install http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/pub/software/brainjam/brainjam.rb


  * WEBSITES
