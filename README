 * About This Program

Brain Jam is a solitaire card game. It is similar to soltaire games
like Freecell in that the entire deck is dealt out face up at the
start, so the player has full information. However, unlike many
solitaire programs, Brain Jam comes with a large but finite number of
initial orderings, all of which are guaranteed to be solvable. Thus
there is no luck factor in playing Brain Jam.

Once you have solved a given configuration, you can then  go back and
work to find a new solution with fewer moves.


 * Prerequisites

Brain Jam depends on the following libraries:

* ncursesw
* SDL2
* SDL2_ttf
* fontconfig
* zlib

In order to compile Brain Jam, you will need to have installed these
libraries along with their include files. For most Linux users, this
means that you will need to have installed the development packages.
For example, on a Debian-based system, you would run something like:

  sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev zlib1g-dev
                   libncursesw5-dev libfontconfig1-dev

Brain Jam can be configured to remove its dependency on some but not
all of the above libraries, at the expense of removing program
functionality. See the "Configuration" section below for details.

In addition, the build process makes use of Python and the python
image library PIL, pkg-config, gzip, and sed.


 * Configuration

Run "./configure" to configure the build process to your system. You
can use "--prefix", "--exec-prefix", "--datarootdir", "--bindir",
and/or "--mandir" to control where the files will be installed. The
following flags can also be used to modify the nature of the program:

  --enable-debug

If present, the program will be built with debugging symbols. The
default is "--disable-debug". 

  --without-ncurses

This flag will remove the program's dependency on the ncursesw
library, at the expense of dropping the alternative text-based user
interface. (The default is "--with-ncurses".)

  --without-sdl

This flag will remove the program's dependency on the SDL2 library (as
well as SDL2_ttf and zlib), at the expense of leaving out the graphic
user interface. Only the text-based interface will be avaiable. (The
default is "--with-sdl".)

  --without-fontconfig

This flag will remove the program's dependency on the fontconfig
library. (The default is "--with-fontconfig".) This will cause the
program to require a full path to a font file to be supplied when the
program runs. The path can be added to the initialization file
"brainjam.ini" (see "Files" below), with a line such as:

  font=/usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont/FreeSerif.otf

(Alternately, the path can be hard-coded into the binary by editing
"src/sdl/getfont.c" before compiling. Hey, I don't judge.)


 * Installing

Running "make install" with the necessary permissions will install the
brainjam executable and the man page. There are no external data files
that the program requires access to in order to run.


 * How to Play

Brain Jam comes with its own documentation. You can type "?" or F1 at
any time while the program is running to switch to the help display.
The documentation is also available in "Help.txt" in the top-level
directory, for those who prefer to read plain text files.


 * Files

Brain Jam creates a directory "~/.brainjam" for storing your
individual settings and game state.

Two files in this directory are worth mentioning specifically. The
file "brainjam.ini" stores your current settings, such as the number
of the most recent game. The file "brainjam.sol" contains your best
solutions for each game you've completed. Note that these files
intentionally use the same filename and format as the original Windows
program. If you used this program, you should be able to copy your old
files over and have all of your existing solutions available in this
program.

The other files in this directory have names of the form "session-*",
and store undo history for each game.


 * Websites

The home page for this program is at:

The website for the original Brain Jam program is at:

From there you can obtain the original 16-bit Windows binary, as well
as play a variant version that runs in the browser.

This program is written by Brian Raiter. The original game comes from
the Brain Jam program for Windows, which was written by Peter Liepa.

The rules of Brain Jam are based on "Baker's Game", as described by
Martin Gardner in the June 1968 issue of Scientific American.

The deck configurations were created by Peter Liepa with assistance
from Bert van Oortmarssen, and are used here with their permission.

The graphics that appear in Brain Jam (with the exception of the
original Brain Jam icon), are either taken from public domain sources,
or have been explicitly placed in the public domain by their creators.
