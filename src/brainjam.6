brainjam \- a solitaire puzzle game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B brainjam [OPTIONS] [ID]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Brain Jam
is a playing-card puzzle game created by Peter Liepa, based
on "Baker's Game", as described by Martin Gardner in the June 1968
issue of Scientific American.
.PP
Brain Jam begins by presenting a list of available games. Each game
uses the same rules but a differently shuffled deck. Each game has a
known best solution, so after solving a particular game you can also
return to in order to improve your solution.
.PP
If an \fIID\fR is supplied on the command line, Brain Jam will begin
with that game selected. Otherwise, Brain Jam defaults to your most
recently played game.
.PP
Press \fB?\fR or \fBF1\fR to view help within the game. The in-game
