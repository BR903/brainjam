# sdl/sprites/layout.txt: locations of parts of the sprite sheet
#
# This data file lists the various small images that the program uses.
# and provides a layout for placing them into a single image file. The
# mkimages.py script uses this data to build the individual images
# into a single sprite sheet. The script also uses this data file to
# generate two C files, which are included into the source code to
# provide access to the original small images.
#
# This file must be updated if changes are made to the images that
# affect their size, or if images are added or removed.
